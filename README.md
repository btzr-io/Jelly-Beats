# Decentralized music streaming platform [![David](https://img.shields.io/david/btzr-io/jelly-beats.svg?style=flat-square)](https://david-dm.org/btzr-io/jelly-beats)[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/btzr-io/jelly-beats.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/btzr-io/electron-preact-app/blob/master/LICENSE)

> What? A decentralized music streaming platform.
How? We are developing an open source desktop application using the electron framework, react, web workers, unistore.js and the lbry-protocol.
**Disclaimer:**
We don’t intend to develop a real working product that can compete or replace other centralized platforms such as soundcloud, spotify, deezer (At least not right now).
Our main goal right now it’s to develop a simple but functional application to showcase the current potential of the lbry-protocol for media distribution and discovery using simple web technologies.
